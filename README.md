# JSONanalyser
Test Project to Analyse given JSON data
## Class description:

The Article class represents a single Beer article, containing information such as its ID, 
a short description, price, unit of measurement, price per unit text, and an image.

The Beer class contains additional information about a Bear, including the Beer's ID, brand name, name, a list of articles that belong to the Beer class, 
and a description text.

The Article class can be used on its own to represent a single Beer, while the Beer class can be used to group related articles together as part of a product.
